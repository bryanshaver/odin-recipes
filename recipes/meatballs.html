    <p>This recipe, <em>Italian Meatballs</em>, is taken from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25193/italian-meatballs/" target="_blank">www.allrecipes.com</a> and can be prepared with spaghetti or eaten alone. As good as these meatballs are, they will never be as good as my mom's. Even if they are, I'm not allowed to say otherwise. The choice of baking the meatballs before putting them into the pasta sauce makes these meatballs melt in your mouth!</p>
